# You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are
# K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter
# takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as
# possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint
# contiguous sections of board.
